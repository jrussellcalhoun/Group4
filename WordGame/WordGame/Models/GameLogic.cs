/*  Null Coallescing Operator
    
    Online Documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/null-coalescing-operator
    
    Syntax: <<left-hand-operand>> ?? <<right-hand-operand>> 

    This operator returns the value of the left-hand-operand if it is not null, otherwise it returns the value of the right-hand-operand
    Operands must be a Nullable Type (see below) or a Reference value    
    This is a shorter way of coding something like: 

    return <<left-hand-operand>> != null ? <<left-hand-operand>> : new <<left-hand-operand-type-instance>>; 

    or:
    
    if(<<left-hand-operand>> != null)
